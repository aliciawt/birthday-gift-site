🎉 Birthday GIFt Card

This is a fun interactive birthday card website built using HTML and CSS as part of a project from the Scrimba HTML & CSS course.

Instead of a traditional card, it shows a series of gift boxes 🎁 that reveal animated GIFs when you hover over them. Each GIF represents a playful birthday wish for the recipient.

✨ Features

A header with the birthday person's picture, age, and birthday date.

Multiple interactive "gift sections" with hover-reveal GIFs (e.g., happiness, love, genius, badass vibes, cheers 🥂).

Colorful background gradient and custom fonts for a festive design.

A footer linking back to the course where the project was inspired.
